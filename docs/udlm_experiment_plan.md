# UDLM × GenMol research plan

## Claim being tested

The target is not merely to make uniform diffusion run. The final UDLM system
must beat the audited local GenMol MDLM control under a matched protocol.
The primary de-novo criterion is a better quality–diversity trade-off at equal
requested sample count, BERT width/depth, training data, and evaluation definitions.
Matching BERT width/depth is not an equal-parameter comparison. The A0 additive
time conditioner adds 787,968 parameters (about 0.9%), while the selected A1
topology adds 14,962,176 conditioning parameters in total: 787,968 in the
timestep MLP and 14,174,208 in the 12 FiLM projections. Any advantage must be
reported with this material capacity difference.
For a single operating point, success means:

- repaired validity and uniqueness are not lower;
- quality is above the local MDLM mean of 85.80%; and
- diversity is no more than 0.005 below the local MDLM mean of 0.8230.

Final evidence requires three independent 1,000-sample seeds and uncertainty.
Runs of at most 100 samples are engineering diagnostics; registered selection
instead requires 256 samples for each of seeds 1000 and 1001. Generation speed
is reported but is hardware-dependent. A second, independent target is higher
PMO top-10 AUC at the same oracle-call budget.

The registered final decision uses one-sided 95% intervals: quality's lower
bound must exceed the MDLM control, diversity's lower delta bound must exceed
`-0.005`, and validity/uniqueness deltas must exceed `-0.005`. Means and sample
standard deviations remain paper-compatible summaries. Validity uses a pooled
request-level Newcombe--Wilson method-10 interval for two independent
proportions. Uniqueness, quality, and diversity use unpaired Welch intervals
over the three seed-level estimates per method. A molecule-row bootstrap is
forbidden: re-deduplicating resampled rows manufactures duplicates and does not
represent the uncertainty of these nonlinear per-run set metrics.

The current frozen machine-readable protocol is
`experiments/udlm/protocols/de_novo_superiority_v3.json` (raw SHA-256
`27a1f3e4fa66988d77eddeb66025eae64b514c452e089bb5c62fff99060c9f16`,
canonical SHA-256
`e7b108dce51cd1445758a9f7dc852532b2ee075a80f783ae009303a7550577ee`).
It preserves v1 and v2 as historical pre-pilot and pre-health records and
leaves every scientific setting and decision threshold unchanged. V2
strengthened the launch/receipt chain and bound the audited training-only
empirical-prior floor. V3 is a prospective instrumentation repair after the
first 10-update R health process failed its post-training audit on Lightning's
documented unranked-checkpoint `+inf` bookkeeping sentinel. That failed R
performed no denoising or molecular scoring. Since the v2 freeze, no registered
candidate checkpoint was selected or ranked and no candidate final-evaluation
run occurred. Earlier ineligible CPU generation smokes and the audited MDLM
baseline rescoring remain disclosed; v3 does not relabel them. V3 requires a
closed checkpoint schema, exact structural handling of that one live-bound
sentinel, exact checkpoint/config, loop, trainer,
optimizer, scheduler, sampler, and callback bindings, and an independent
closed-schema summary/receipt verifier. Its decision remains an
intersection-union gate: all four point requirements and all four interval
requirements must pass for one candidate that was locked before final seeds
0, 1, and 2. The lock binds the completed training summary and exit receipt,
EMA checkpoint, exact EMA shadow-tensor count/decay/update metadata, and an
immutable `launch_manifest.json` by repository-relative path, raw-byte SHA-256,
and schema. The manifest records the exact ordered GPU UUIDs plus the complete
inventory, initial selection, and final just-before-launch telemetry. The final
UUID probes must still satisfy the registered idle-device policy. Runtime
config, training summary, and successful exit receipt must all bind the same
manifest snapshot and exact UUID list. The lock also binds source/config/
sampler/runner/launcher/rescore/evidence-writer hashes, all disclosed pilot evidence, the winning pilot's exact
checkpoint digest (which must equal the locked training checkpoint), exact 128-NFE sampling
configuration, and one predeclared output directory per final seed.

A repository-global single-training-job lease is acquired before any GPU probe.
Its immutable record is bound into the launch manifest and validated again
before the exit receipt is published; for a handed-off training job, only then
may the receipt writer release that exact lease. The launcher may release its
exact owner lease on failure before tmux handoff. Unexplained or stale leases
fail closed for manual review. The matched R/S/E specification registers
sequential order
`release_uniform` (R), `schedule_uniform` (S), then `empirical_frequency` (E),
at most one training job at a time, and a validated successful receipt before
advancing. R requires explicit genesis; S requires R's successful receipt; E
requires S's. Each successor binds exact stable snapshots of its predecessor's
receipt, manifest, and summary, validates the transitive chain before any GPU
probe, and revalidates the snapshots before manifest and successful-receipt
publication. Every predecessor receipt must strictly predate its successor's
lease acquisition and GPU inventory probe. The global lease separately
machine-enforces the one-job ceiling.
The schema-2 candidate lock also binds the terminal E successful receipt by
path, raw SHA-256, and schema. The final gate reconstructs that terminal
receipt's complete R→S→E chain, requires both the terminal receipt and selected
training receipt to predate the candidate lock, and requires the terminal
matched-panel digest to equal the selected checkpoint's panel digest. This
exact chain must contain the selected R/S/E receipt itself, rather than merely
a separate run with the same panel digest. This proves that all three controls
completed without forcing the selected pilot winner itself to be E.
This is cooperative host/worktree serialization, not a cluster-wide scheduler
reservation.

Training accounting records requested example exposure; it does not claim a
content-token exposure count. Pilot selection may use only seeds at least 1000.
The registered comparison that can make a candidate eligible uses generation
seeds 1000 and 1001, 256 requested samples per seed, 128 NFE, and the
released-compatible quality and diversity metrics. The planned seed-1100,
32-request decode diagnostic occurs only after a candidate has completed its
1,000-update training run. It and any other smaller or 32/64-NFE run remain
disclosed engineering evidence but cannot authorize an optimization screen or
enter the selection score. The machine-readable winner is the highest mean
quality, then highest mean diversity, then lexicographically smallest attempt ID.
Artifacts using benchmark-run schema 6 or aggregate-report schema 5 are
rejected; the required versions are candidate lock 2, candidate ledger 2,
pilot envelope 2, launcher failure receipt 1, benchmark 7, report 6, launch
manifest 2, training runtime config 2, training summary 5, and successful exit
receipt 5.

The MDLM side of the gate is independently bound to
`experiments/udlm/baselines/mdlm_50000_rescore_attestation.json` (SHA-256
`6326b63c38c7052d0b47282d611618f77637496da2785779af69097fc1441323`).
That immutable attestation was produced from clean, already-pushed revision
`74482c2742ab5ad15def122c809a6b4e403e94cf` by three fresh CPU Python
interpreters, one for each seed 0, 1, and 2, with `PYTHONHASHSEED` equal to the
seed. Current code matched all 63,000 of 63,000 compared historical row cells
under the frozen per-field rules and reproduced the exact released-compatible
and strict per-seed metrics and aggregates. The rescore bound the verified SA
table and hashes for the runtime metric, chemistry, RDKit, SAFE, and runner
modules; it neither regenerated molecules nor rewrote or mutated historical
raw rows or summaries. Its network claim is deliberately narrow: offline
environment settings and Python-level guards covered four socket/name-resolution
APIs, but there was no OS- or process-level isolation and no claim about native
extensions, subprocesses, raw sockets, datagrams, or other unguarded APIs.

Before evaluating a UDLM candidate, the superiority gate verifies the frozen
MDLM manifest and this attestation by path and SHA-256, then checks their source,
row, aggregate, and metric-provenance bindings. Candidate choice is still made
only from the fully disclosed, immutable pilot ledger using the registered
eligible two-seed panel and the predeclared quality-then-diversity ordering; the
winner is committed and pushed in a single candidate lock before any final seed
is run.

Candidate-ledger schema 2 binds one outcome envelope per actually launched
pilot seed. A completed schema-2 envelope contains no selectable score: it
points to the exact schema-7 summary, raw CSV, and successful schema-5 training
receipt. Both the evidence writer and the final gate run the structural reporter
and a fresh CPU worker that re-decodes `raw_model_text`, recomputes QED, SA, and
both diversity branches, and checks all 21 row fields and failure counts. A
failed envelope must instead point to the launcher's schema-1 no-clobber failure
receipt. The gate validates its exact command, clean pushed source revision,
checkpoint/config, launcher and log bytes, and any partial summary/CSV bytes;
these supporting artifacts must be force-added when ignored by Git. A failure
makes the whole attempt ineligible but does not erase a sibling seed that
completed. Every success and failure timestamp must predate the candidate lock,
and every producing revision must be an ancestor of the final benchmark
revision. The final three candidate runs are independently re-scored from their
raw CSVs again before a superiority decision is written.

Because `output/` is ignored, publishing an envelope is not the archival step.
Before committing the ledger, use `git add -f -- <receipt> <log> [<partial> ...]`
for every failure and force-add each completed summary, raw CSV, and successful
training receipt as well. Add the envelope normally, then confirm every
referenced path with `git ls-files --error-unmatch -- <path>`. The revision-time
gate deliberately fails if any reference or nested support artifact is absent
from the Git object database.

This authenticates every disclosed outcome; it does not independently prove
ledger completeness. There is no host-wide, append-only launch registry, so the
claim that every attempted pilot was disclosed still depends on the operator
and launcher workflow not omitting or deleting an attempt. The final decision
records this limitation explicitly.

## Faithful baseline before hypotheses

The first implementation follows UDLM at official revision `edb0f8c`:

1. The forward process replaces tokens with uniform vocabulary draws.
2. BERT emits the simplex-valued proxy inserted into the plug-in bridge and
   receives the log-linear noise level through a learned sinusoidal time
   adapter. The 2024 UDLM paper calls this a clean-token prediction, but the
   later [Uniform Diffusion Models Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.22765)
   analysis shows that the standard plug-in ELBO is optimized by the
   leave-one-out (LOO) posterior rather than the ordinary denoising posterior.
3. Training uses continuous-time Eq. 18, evaluated with an algebraically exact
   non-negative form to avoid cancellation.
4. Sampling starts from iid uniform tokens and resamples every editable token
   through the exact reverse posterior on a fixed time grid. The official
   128-step grid is the faithful control; 32/64-step grids are speed ablations.

Concretely, for sequence position $\ell$, the LOO target predicts the clean
token from $z_t^{-\ell}$, excluding that position's own noisy observation. Let
$r_j$ denote this LOO probability for candidate clean category $j$, let $d_j$
denote the ordinary denoising posterior conditioned on all of $z_t$, and let
the observed category at position $\ell$ be $i$. For the full-support rank-one
process with stationary prior $\pi$,

$$d_j\propto r_j\,[\alpha_t\mathbf1\{j=i\}+(1-\alpha_t)\pi_i],\qquad
r_j\propto\frac{d_j}{\alpha_t\mathbf1\{j=i\}+(1-\alpha_t)\pi_i}.$$

Our existing network output remains the raw plug-in bridge parameter and is
therefore interpreted as a learned LOO predictor; the current architecture does
not enforce exact invariance to its own noisy token. This later clarification
does not retroactively change the faithful 2024 objective or frozen screens,
but it determines where later temperature/top-p transforms belong and motivates
an exact conversion audit before treating the output as a true denoiser.

Two implementation differences are repairs, not hypotheses: the unused
reconstruction forward pass is omitted, and the stable Eq. 18 identity replaces
the released subtraction of large terms. GenMol sequence framing is clamped:
BOS, EOS, padding, and supplied context cannot be overwritten. This is a
molecular inpainting adaptation absent from the UDLM QM9 release.

The compatibility mode deliberately retains the released schedule mismatch:
corruption/sampling use `alpha(t)=1-0.999t`, while Eq. 18 uses the idealized
`alpha(t)=1-t`. A schedule-consistent repair must be tested separately.

## Main risk and testable hypotheses

UDLM beat MDLM on QM9 with a vocabulary of about 40. GenMol's SAFE model has
about 1,880 states, and the UDLM paper itself reports that uniform diffusion
degrades as the vocabulary grows. The experiments therefore proceed in this
order:

1. **Full-vocabulary UDLM** — scientific control matching released behavior.
2. **Exclude control symbols** — remove PAD/BOS/EOS/UNK/MASK from the uniform
   corruption prior; this is an explicitly labeled chemistry adaptation.
3. **MDLM EMA warm-start** — reuse only BERT weights, while resetting optimizer,
   scheduler, step, time adapter, and EMA. This tests sample efficiency, not a
   from-scratch architecture comparison.
4. **Schedule-consistent loss** — use the same alpha and derivative in
   corruption, Eq. 18, and sampling.
5. **Smaller or structured corruption alphabet** — only if the controls show
   that the 1,880-way uniform prior is the limiting factor. Candidate versions
   are a smaller SAFE tokenizer and token-type-restricted noise. These change
   the model/data representation and require their own MDLM controls.
6. **Frequency-tempered categorical diffusion** — use a pinned training-prefix
   frequency estimate with a uniform floor, but only after deriving and testing
   its exact non-uniform posterior and objective. A diagnostic sampler is not a
   valid UDLM result and must never be promoted as one.

GenMol MCG is disabled for UDLM until posterior-space guidance is implemented.
Combining clean logits would not equal the UDLM paper's D-CFG rule.

### Pilot-only empirical-floor selection

The historical/manual categorical configuration and its immutable CPU artifacts
use uniform mixture weight `0.01`. A later CPU-only audit, recorded at
`experiments/udlm/prior_geometry/floor_selection_train_rows_10001_30000.json`
(73,953 bytes, SHA-256
`02908dafaf589ca9a49e560aa1eab470a18d6bfe616b781164784c489f54a9f1`),
replayed the pinned stream from clean pushed source
`6424b323084358ea050ba22d7e13ef8d45962496`. It exactly reproduced the frozen
first-10,000-row count vector before evaluating two disjoint later training
blocks against that fixed prior estimate.

For first-prefix counts $c_j$, total $C=\sum_jc_j$, and $K=1880$, the audit
uses $\pi_{w,j}=(1-w)c_j/C+w/K$. For held-out block counts $d_{b,j}$ and
$D_b=\sum_jd_{b,j}$, it minimizes
$L_b(w)=-D_b^{-1}\sum_jd_{b,j}\log\pi_{w,j}$. Rows 10,001--20,000 contain
512,587 content tokens, including 78 tokens from 41 first-prefix-unseen types;
their continuous optimum is `0.00016593802382907556`. Rows 20,001--30,000
contain 513,326 content tokens, including 91 tokens from 62 such types; their
optimum is `0.00019334112119092408`. The rounded `0.0002` candidate lowers
unigram NLL relative to `0.01` by `0.00860566722454914` and
`0.008485138280406979` nats/token, respectively.

The reviewed pilot launcher therefore uses `0.0002` for E while placing the
same otherwise-ignored field in R and S configurations to preserve their
matched-config contract. This is a disclosed retrospective training-data
engineering choice: the rule was formalized after both blocks were inspected.
It is not preregistered confirmation, sequence-model evidence, molecular
quality evidence, or evidence that UDLM beats GenMol. The final seeds and
generation metrics were not used. Only the later matched E-versus-S comparison
can estimate the empirical-prior effect.

The pinned official UDLM QM9 recipe uses 25,000 optimizer steps, global batch
2,048, peak learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$, 1,000 warmup steps, and cosine
decay to $3\times10^{-6}$. The screen's L0 is this project's inherited
GenMol-style constant schedule with 2,500-step warmup, not the released UDLM
schedule. L1 keeps the official peak/floor and cosine idea but scales the
warmup to 50 and horizon to 1,000 for a 100-update diagnostic. It is therefore
a schedule bundle hypothesis rather than an exact official-recipe replay.

## Progressive gates

1. CPU equation, gradient, legacy-checkpoint, and sampler tests.
2. Tiny CPU overfit on a fixed set of molecules; require falling loss, finite
   gradients, and an executable 16-step reverse chain.
3. Run the full-size warm-start R/S/E panel for 10 optimizer updates in that
   order. Each job must
   hold the global lease, use the same matched-panel contract, produce a valid
   receipt, save/reload its checkpoint, and remain finite. This is a health and
   plumbing check only. The current constant schedule warms up for 2,500 steps;
   with peak learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$, its learning rate is only about
   $1.2\times10^{-6}$ by update 10. Ten steps therefore cannot rank methods.
   The frozen health entry point is `scripts/udlm/launch_health_panel.py`, with
   world size $W\in\{1,2\}$ or a CPU-only `--dry-run`. The later scale-up
   wrapper has its own registered 1--4 GPU arithmetic. The health wrapper fixes
   launcher variants `udlm` (R),
   `schedule_uniform` (S), and `udlm_categorical` (E); seed 1; one loader
   worker; 10 optimizer updates; full-vocabulary training; and the verified
   MDLM EMA warm start from `outputs/paper_v1/checkpoints/50000.ckpt`, whose
   size is 1,396,998,679 bytes and SHA-256 is
   `8d00aa47b02f64bf39ff6b0b2e786f213587366fc2c3d29712a00f3f84108dd6`.
   The completed health lineage used $W=1$, per-process microbatch $m=2$, and
   accumulation $a_1=8$, so its effective batch was
   $B_{\mathrm{eff}}=Wma_W=16$. Every arm also carried the
   audited empirical-mixture field `0.0002` (active only for E), utilization
   strictly below 10%, at least 30,000 MiB free, and non-prohibited compute
   mode. Active compute processes are recorded but do not disqualify a device
   under the user's utilization-based idle definition; no launcher interrupts
   or kills them.

   Let $H$ be the full 40-character clean pushed source revision used by the
   wrapper. Its deterministic run names are `health-w{W}-r-{H}`,
   `health-w{W}-s-{H}`, and `health-w{W}-e-{H}`; each invocation launches only
   the first missing arm after a successful prefix and rejects incomplete,
   failed, malformed, or out-of-order directories. A failed receipt permanently
   closes that source-revision namespace: preserve its run directory and log in
   place, repair and push a descendant revision, and restart a fresh R→S→E
   lineage whose full-revision run names cannot collide with the failed one.
   Never rename, delete, overwrite, or promote a failed arm's checkpoint. A
   pass is not a favorable
   loss or generated molecule. It is
   `output/udlm/health-w{W}-e-{H}/pilot_exit_status.json` accepted by
   `scripts/udlm/validate_health_panel.py`, including the exact contract above,
   the complete schema-5 R→S→E receipt chain, verified EMA loading, finite
   training/checkpoint state, and checkpoint save/reload. The normalized result
   allows only `screen_authorization`; generation, ranking, superiority, and
   candidate-lock eligibility are all false.

   This gate is complete. The successful W=1 chain was produced from clean
   pushed revision
   `34856c275049cd329320f6c01171f0d2d34cd814` (H), and its terminal E receipt
   authorized only preparation of the optimization screens. It supplied no
   generation metrics and no molecular-quality claim.

   Training-summary schema 5 checks every model, EMA, optimizer, and remaining
   non-sentinel floating checkpoint tensor for finiteness. It separately
   verifies the sole allowed non-finite framework record: Lightning 2.5.1's
   scalar float32 `ModelCheckpoint.kth_value=+inf` sentinel for the exact
   unmonitored minimum-mode callback. Any other value, shape, callback state,
   path, framework version, or additional non-finite tensor fails closed.
4. **Completed registered scheduler screen:** on E only, seed 17, compare 100
   updates of E-L0 (the current additive conditioner
   and constant schedule with 2,500-update warmup) against E-L1 (the same
   model/process with a 1,000-update half-cosine horizon, warmup 50, peak
   learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$, and clamped floor $3\times10^{-6}$). E-L1 is
   one optimizer-schedule bundle, not an isolated test of cosine curvature: over
   the first 100 optimizer updates its cumulative learning-rate exposure is
   approximately 37.57 times E-L0's. On the fixed denoising panel at
   $t\in\{0.1,0.5,0.9\}$, select E-L1 only if its pooled content-token loss is
   at least 2% lower, at least two of the three time bins improve, and no bin is
   more than 2% worse. A complete valid screen that misses a threshold retains
   E-L0; missing, malformed, or unmatched evidence yields no winner. The
   registered W=1 evidence selected E-L1: pooled loss fell from
   `68513.0489201366 / 40881 = 1.675914212` to
   `44204.2809926042 / 40881 = 1.081291578`, a `35.4804935858%` reduction,
   and L1 was lower in all three time bins. The evidence and selection are
   committed at `experiments/udlm/screens/scheduler_evidence.json` and
   `experiments/udlm/screens/scheduler_selection.json`. This denoising-screen
   result contains no generation metric and is not a superiority result.
5. **Completed registered conditioning screen:** on E only, seed 17, train 500
   updates with the selected scheduler. Both E-A0 and
   E-A1 start independently from the same verified MDLM-EMA checkpoint; neither
   continues a 100-update scheduler-screen checkpoint. Both reseed the training
   RNG after model construction and warm-start loading so A1's extra parameter
   initialization does not shift the corruption/dropout stream. A0 retains the
   zero-output additive conditioner. A1 normally initializes the timestep MLP,
   applies an outer SiLU, and sends the result to one zero-initialized
   $H\to2H$ FiLM projection after each BERT layer. Select A1 only if it exactly
   preserves warm-start logits before training, pooled fixed-panel content-token
   loss is at least 2% lower, no $t\in\{0.1,0.5,0.9\}$ bin is more than 2% worse,
   clean-token accuracy is nondecreasing, every FiLM parameter has a finite
   nonzero gradient at the first post-accumulation optimizer observation, and
   every timestep-MLP parameter has a finite
   nonzero gradient after the first **nonzero-learning-rate** FiLM update
   (optimizer observation three under either registered schedule, because update
   one uses learning rate zero). A complete valid screen that misses a selection
   condition retains A0; malformed or incomplete evidence yields no winner.
   The registered W=1 evidence selected E-A1: pooled loss fell from
   `114483.5594098568 / 40881 = 2.800409956` to
   `39984.46089004135 / 40881 = 0.978069541`, a `65.0740585843%` reduction;
   A1 was lower in every time bin and passed all five registered gates. A0/A1
   initial logits were byte-identical with shape `[2, 4, 1880]` and SHA-256
   `3e6ef7368f9a11d061640948ac5955fba81c2acac6546a12adc4efc5e22e15b8`.
   All 24 FiLM tensors had finite nonzero gradients at observation one and all
   four timestep-MLP tensors did at observation three. The evidence and
   selection are committed at `experiments/udlm/screens/conditioning_evidence.json`
   and `experiments/udlm/screens/conditioning_selection.json`. This is still a
   fixed denoising-panel result, not a molecular benchmark.
6. Train matched R/S/E controls for 1,000 updates each with the selected
   scheduler and architecture. Only after each 1,000-update training receipt
   validates, decode 32 requests with generation seed 1100 as an ineligible
   post-scale-up decode diagnostic. It cannot retroactively authorize either
   optimization screen or rank candidates. Candidate eligibility still
   requires the registered 256-request runs for both seeds 1000 and 1001 at
   128 NFE. All smaller or mismatched panels remain disclosed but ineligible;
   final seeds 0, 1, and 2 are unavailable for tuning or selection. Supported
   registered world sizes are $W\in\{1,2,3,4\}$. With per-process microbatch
   two, accumulation $a_W=(8,4,3,2)$ yields effective global batch
   $(16,16,18,16)$ for $W=(1,2,3,4)$. One registry freezes one world size and
   identical batch arithmetic for all three arms. The first scale-up rung will
   freeze W=1: E-A1 has already completed 500 full-size updates at W=1, making
   1,000 updates a controlled twofold increase without simultaneously adding
   an untested multi-process topology. Immediately before each sequential job
   the
   launcher scans the full NVIDIA inventory, dynamically selects GPUs eligible
   only when utilization is strictly below 10%, free memory is at least 30,000
   MiB, and compute mode is not prohibited; it re-probes their exact UUIDs and
   binds the telemetry through
   the launch/runtime/summary/receipt evidence chain.
   Operationally, terminal E must first be validated while HEAD remains the
   exact clean, pushed R6 revision. The current R4 tree deliberately does not
   yet expose production candidate-ledger or candidate-lock builders, and the
   generic generation/evidence publishers have not received the scale
   launcher's descriptor-bound path hardening. Before seed 1100, publish and
   review an R6 descendant that closes those path/lease gaps and provides
   no-clobber schema-2 ledger/lock CLIs; never hand-author either authority or
   relabel the R6 training source.
   For each completed seed, run `scripts/udlm/write_pilot_evidence.py
   --outcome completed ...` to publish its reference-only envelope after
   independent raw rescoring. If either the small engineering mode or the
   registered-selection mode fails, retain the launcher-authored
   `failure_receipt.json`, its log, and any partial artifacts, then run the same
   writer with `--outcome failed --failure-receipt <path> ...`. The failure
   receipt and envelope bind the exact pilot mode and requested sample count;
   never hand-author an envelope or replace an attempt ID.
7. Advance only a promising candidate to 2,000–5,000 steps if the registered
   pilot evidence justifies the cost.
8. After the terminal E receipt proves the complete matched R/S/E panel, close
   and commit the complete pilot ledger, then commit and push one schema-2
   candidate lock. The lock binds that E receipt even when R or S wins pilot
   selection. Only that locked revision may run the three 1,000-sample final
   seeds, once each in their predeclared directories at 128 NFE. Update the
   benchmark PDF only after the raw-row reporter and registered superiority
   gate both validate the result and the final gate independently re-scores all
   three raw candidate CSVs.

   This later 1,000-update terminal-E receipt is distinct from the 10-update
   health-terminal receipt. The health receipt authorizes only screen
   preparation and cannot satisfy the candidate lock; the later receipt must
   share the locked candidate's matched-panel digest.

The completed optimization screens used a health revision plus a three-revision
firewall.
The clean pushed revision $H$ must contain the health implementation but neither
GPU-count-specific config family. Only after `validate_health_panel.py` accepts
the deterministic terminal-E receipt for the chosen $W$ may the CPU-only
preparer materialize two scheduler configs and four conditioning configs (A0/A1
contingent on either scheduler), all at effective global batch 16 with
per-process microbatch 2. R0 must be the single-parent child of $H$ and differ
from it by exactly those six selected-$W$ JSON files; the unselected config
family and registry must remain absent. Before freezing, the preparer validates
the same H-bound terminal receipt again, proves the exact H-to-R0 diff, validates
every live/Git blob, replays each config through the launcher's Hydra
composition, and streams the exact MDLM checkpoint hash. It writes the registry
as the only R0-to-R1 candidate. After that registry-only commit is pushed, R1
may run E-L0/E-L1. Their evidence and deterministic selection are the only
permitted R1-to-R2 additions. Pushed R2 may then run only the A0/A1 configs
contingent on the selected scheduler. This ordering prevents a result from
changing its health authority, its own registry, or its later conditioning
comparison.

The selection-bound scale-up uses a second prospective publication firewall.
R4 contains only the generic 1--4 GPU framework, compatibility changes,
documentation, notebook material, and CPU tests. Its CPU-only preparer then
derives the chosen-$W$ R/S/E configurations from the four committed screen
evidence/selection files, independently recomputes the selected `E-L1` and
`E-A1` decisions, and binds their raw and canonical hashes. Exactly those three
configuration files are the sole R4-to-R5 change. Exactly one registry that
freezes those configs, the R1-to-R3 screen chronology, MDLM checkpoint,
training order, and output namespaces is the sole R5-to-R6 change. Only a
clean, pushed R6 may launch. Every member uses seed 17, 1,000 optimizer updates,
`training.reseed_after_model_initialization=true`, and a fresh verified MDLM
EMA warm start; optimizer, scheduler, global step, and EMA state restart rather
than continuing either screen checkpoint. R launches first, S requires R's
validated receipt, and E requires S's validated receipt. A screen checkpoint or
partial scale-up run can never be relabeled as a registered scale-up result.

### What the selected L1 and A1 arms change

For optimizer-update index $k\in\{0,\ldots,99\}$, peak learning rate
$\eta=3\times10^{-4}$, L0 warmup $w_0=2500$, L1 warmup $w_1=50$, L1 horizon
$h=1000$, and floor $\eta_{\min}=3\times10^{-6}$, the learning-rate paths are

$$
\eta_{L0}(k)=\eta\frac{k}{w_0},
$$

and

$$
\eta_{L1}(k)=
\begin{cases}
\eta k/w_1, & 0\le k<w_1,\\
\eta_{\min}+(\eta-\eta_{\min})
\frac{1+\cos\!\left(\pi(k-w_1)/(h-w_1)\right)}{2}, & w_1\le k\le h.
\end{cases}
$$

Here $k$ counts optimizer updates, not microbatches. Consequently,
$\sum_{k=0}^{99}\eta_{L0}(k)=5.94\times10^{-4}$ and
$\sum_{k=0}^{99}\eta_{L1}(k)=0.022317219370972547$, giving a ratio
$37.571076\ldots$. This sum is a transparent exposure diagnostic, not an
equivalent number of AdamW steps or a bound on parameter displacement. Because
warmup length, early learning rates, later half-cosine decay, and floor are one
bundle, any observed L1 improvement must be attributed to that bundle.

Let $S_{a,j}$ be the summed content-token loss and $N_{a,j}$ its integer token
denominator for arm $a$ and time bin $j$. Define
$\ell_{a,j}=S_{a,j}/N_{a,j}$ and pooled
$L_a=(\sum_j S_{a,j})/(\sum_j N_{a,j})$. The screen compares these fractions by
exact cross-products: L1 needs $L_{L1}\le0.98L_{L0}$, strict improvement in at
least two $\ell_{a,j}$ values, and $\ell_{L1,j}\le1.02\ell_{L0,j}$ in every bin.
For a concrete equal-denominator example, $N_{a,j}=100$, L0 sums
$(1000,600,200)$, and L1 sums $(970,570,202)$ give bin means
$(10,6,2)$ versus $(9.7,5.7,2.02)$: pooled loss improves about 3.2%, two bins
strictly improve, and the last regresses only 1%.

For A1, let batch size be $B$, sequence length $S$, BERT hidden width $H$, layer
index $l\in\{1,\ldots,L\}$, per-example UDLM noise vector
$\sigma\in\mathbb R^B$, normally initialized timestep MLP
$g:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R^H$, timestep
embedding $c=\operatorname{SiLU}(g(\sigma))\in\mathbb R^{B\times H}$, and the
ordinary post-LayerNorm output of BERT layer $l$ be
$y_l\in\mathbb R^{B\times S\times H}$. Each new projection computes

$$
[\beta_l,\gamma_l]=W_lc+b_l\in\mathbb R^{B\times2H},\qquad
h_l=(1+\gamma_l[:,\mathrm{None},:])\odot y_l+
\beta_l[:,\mathrm{None},:].
$$

$\beta_l$ is the shift, $\gamma_l$ the scale residual, $W_l$ and $b_l$ the
trainable projection with $W_l\in\mathbb R^{2H\times H}$ and
$b_l\in\mathbb R^{2H}$, and $\odot$ elementwise multiplication. The explicit
encoder loop passes $h_l$ into stock BERT layer $l+1$ (and the final $h_L$ to
the classifier); it uses neither hooks nor mutable forward state. Both $W_l$
and $b_l$ start at zero, so $h_l=y_l$ exactly for every $\sigma$ and the MDLM
warm-start logits are unchanged. The timestep MLP $g$ must *not* also have a
zero output: a nonzero $c$ lets each $W_l$ receive a gradient at optimizer-
gradient observation one. Since every $W_l$ is zero then, the gradient into $g$
is zero at that observation by construction. Both registered schedules use
learning-rate index zero on optimizer update one, so that zero-rate step leaves
$W_l=0$ and observation two also gives zero gradient to $g$. Optimizer update
two has positive learning rate and changes $W_l$; observation three can make
$g$'s gradient nonzero. The gate is therefore phrased as "after the first nonzero-rate FiLM
update," rather than assuming that the first optimizer call changes weights.

The exact production observation topology is frozen in
`experiments/udlm/protocols/film_gradient_contract_v1.json` (raw SHA-256
`b2a666a23351eb0882a179f7ae5d09fafd2188fee924313cdf60ee94888e7ac5`,
canonical SHA-256
`ff45961276df75f445221fd1aa4629262d21fdb852bd9b226ad56fe2559315d5`).
It lists all 24 FiLM tensors and four timestep-MLP tensors in model order.
Training-summary schema 5 records a contract-bound audit for A1 and explicit
null for every other arm; exit-receipt schema 5 independently validates and
echoes it. Every optimization-screen arm also records
`screen_initialization_state_audit` immediately after the verified MDLM-EMA
warm start and before any optional RNG reseed, dataloader, trainer, optimizer,
or scheduler construction. Let $S$ be the sorted `backbone.state_dict()` and
$C\subset S$ remove every timestep-MLP and FiLM name. A domain-separated
SHA-256 frames each tensor's name, dtype, shape, and exact raw bytes. Scheduler
arms must have identical full-state and common-state hashes; A0/A1 must have an
identical common-state hash, while their topology-specific full hashes may
differ. The summary retains this ten-field certificate and receipt schema 5
validates and echoes it, so free-form evidence cannot substitute arbitrary
initial-state digest strings.

For a toy state with one shared weight and one timestep weight, changing only
the timestep tensor changes the full hash but preserves the common hash;
changing the shared weight changes both. The separate fixed literal CPU probe
then tests the stronger functional invariant required for A0/A1: their raw
float32 logit bytes must be exactly equal before training. Released GenMol has
neither certificate because it has no optimization-screen conditioner pair;
this is experimental provenance plumbing, not a change to its MDLM method.

The full-size pre-registry CPU diagnostic has exercised that invariant against
the actual 50,000-step MDLM EMA. A0 and A1 each emitted a `[2, 4, 1880]`
tensor, or 60,160 raw little-endian float32 bytes, with the identical SHA-256
`3e6ef7368f9a11d061640948ac5955fba81c2acac6546a12adc4efc5e22e15b8`.
The sequential check took 33.55 seconds and about 3,578,044 KiB peak RSS. It is
a topology diagnostic only: because no GPU-count-specific registry or pushed
conditioning-authorization revision existed, it cannot substitute for the
registered audit that gates A0/A1 selection. The later registered W=1 screen
independently reproduced the same shape and digest before selecting A1.

For example, with $B=2$, $S=4$, $H=24$, and $L=2$, $c$ has shape `[2, 24]`,
each projection produces `[2, 48]`, each shift and scale has shape `[2, 24]`,
and broadcasting `[2, 1, 24]` over the four positions preserves a hidden tensor
of shape `[2, 4, 24]`. In the production model, $H=768$ and $L=12$; each
projection has weight shape `[1536, 768]` and bias shape `[1536]`, for
14,174,208 FiLM parameters. Together with the 787,968-parameter timestep MLP,
A1 has 14,962,176 conditioning parameters. Its explicit MDLM-EMA initializer
loads the same 202 base BERT tensors as A0, excludes four timestep and 24 FiLM
parameter tensors, then creates 230 fresh EMA shadows. A0 retains its legacy
state-key set; A1 checkpoints carry a structural conditioning manifest and must
not load as A0 or vice versa.

This topology is inspired by, but is not identical to, released UDLM. Released
GenMol's BERT has no time input. Official UDLM uses a rotary, pre-LayerNorm DiT
whose normally initialized timestep MLP is followed by an outer SiLU; every DiT
block emits two shift/scale/gate triplets and its output layer has another
shift/scale pair. A1 instead preserves GenMol's absolute-position, post-LayerNorm
BERT and applies only one shift/scale pair after each layer, with no residual
gate. It is a warm-start-compatible hypothesis, not a paper result.

Checkpoint: why must both 500-update arms reload the same MDLM EMA and reseed
after initialization? Expected reasoning: continuing a scheduler-screen model
would give one arm extra data exposure, while construction of A1 consumes RNG
for extra parameters; a fresh common checkpoint plus post-init reseed removes
those two avoidable confounds. Why is L1 a bundle rather than a clean cosine
ablation? Expected reasoning: its 50-update warmup changes the first-100-update
learning-rate sum by about 37.57 times, long before much cosine decay occurs.
Why are zero FiLM projections compatible with useful first-step gradients?
Expected reasoning: they make the forward map the identity, but the normally
initialized timestep MLP supplies nonzero $c$, so projection gradients can be
nonzero. Why need the timestep MLP not become nonzero until optimizer-gradient
observation three under these schedules? Expected reasoning: at observation one
its upstream Jacobian contains zero $W_l$; optimizer update one also has zero
learning rate, so observation two sees zero $W_l$ again. Optimizer update two is
the first positive-rate update, allowing observation three to propagate through
nonzero FiLM weights.

The warm-start route is an operational sample-efficiency comparison: it uses
the MDLM checkpoint's previous data exposure. A method-only claim additionally
requires a from-scratch UDLM run and an equal-extra-step MDLM continuation.

Every run records Git SHA, source checkpoint/hash, seed, physical-to-logical GPU
mapping, configuration, sample count, step count, wall time, raw generations,
strict and repaired metrics, and deviations from the paper/released code.
Quality additionally binds the ignored local `oracle/fpscores.pkl` input to
SHA-256 `24a4392f5c673e79c0446af3c4d8e458293b5fecaa244328e76741ead9d21dbf`
and PyTDC 0.4.1 source hashes. The runner loads those verified bytes directly
into the resident TDC SA table and disables TDC's implicit downloader while
scoring; missing, replaced, symlinked, or mismatched inputs fail before model
startup.
